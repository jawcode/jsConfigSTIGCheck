When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.\n\nThis requirement addresses the configuration of network devices to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on device availability. For each network device, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or restricting the number of sessions the device opens at one time). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.\n\nThe security safeguards cannot be defined at the DoD level because they vary according to the capabilities of the individual network devices and the security controls applied on the adjacent networks (e.g., firewalls performing packet filtering to block DoS attacks).",
        "IA_Controls": "",
        "Check_Content": "Review the Cisco switch configuration to verify that it is compliant with this requirement. \n\nStep 1: Verify traffic types have been classified based on importance levels. The following is an example configuration: \n\nclass-map match-all CoPP_CRITICAL \nmatch access-group name CoPP_CRITICAL \nclass-map match-any CoPP_IMPORTANT \nmatch access-group name CoPP_IMPORTANT \nmatch protocol arp \nclass-map match-all CoPP_NORMAL \nmatch access-group name CoPP_NORMAL \nclass-map match-any CoPP_UNDESIRABLE \nmatch access-group name CoPP_UNDESIRABLE \nclass-map match-all CoPP_DEFAULT \nmatch access-group name CoPP_DEFAULT \n\nStep 2: Review the ACLs referenced by the class maps to determine if the traffic is being classified appropriately.

Excessive ARP packets can potentially monopolize Route Processor resources, starving other important processes. Currently, ARP is the only Layer 2 protocol that can be specifically classified using the match protocol command. \n\nStep 3: Review the policy-map to determine if the traffic is being policed appropriately for each classification. The following is an example configuration: \n\npolicy-map CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY \nclass CoPP_CRITICAL \npolice 512000 8000 conform-action transmit exceed-action transmit \nclass CoPP_IMPORTANT \npolice 256000 4000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop \nclass CoPP_NORMAL \npolice 128000 2000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop \nclass CoPP_UNDESIRABLE \npolice 8000 1000 conform-action drop exceed-action drop \nclass CoPP_DEFAULT\npolice 64000 1000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop \n\nStep 4: Verify that the CoPP policy is enabled. The following is an example configuration: \n\ncontrol-plane \nservice-policy input CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY \n\nNote: Control Plane Protection (CPPr) can be used to filter as well as police control plane traffic destined to the RP. CPPr is very similar to CoPP and has the ability to filter and police traffic using finer granularity by dividing the aggregate control plane into three separate categories: (1) host, (2) transit, and (3) CEF-exception. Hence, a separate policy-map could be configured for each traffic category.\n\nIf the Cisco switch is not configured to protect against known types of DoS attacks by employing organization-defined security safeguards, this is a finding.",
